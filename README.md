PHP-ID3
=======

PHP-ID3 makes use of native PHP to read [ID3 Tags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3â€Ž) and thumbnail from a MP3 file. There have been many revisions to ID3 Tags specification; this program makes use of v3.2 of the [spec](http://id3.org/id3v2.3.0).

To read binary data more effectively, I have created a sclass, [BinaryFileReader](https://gist.github.com/shubhamjain/5964350), which reads data in named chunks. 

How to Use
==========

`example.php` provides a sample on how to use the class. You will need to initialize the `ID3Tags_Reader` class with a file handle opened in binary-safe mode.

```php
include "../ID3Tags_Reader.php";

$ID3 = new ID3Tags_Reader( fopen("Exodus - 06 - Piranha.mp3", "rb") );

$ID3->ReadAllTags(); //Calling this is necesarry before others

foreach($ID3->GetID3Array() as $key => $value)
{
	if( $key !== "APIC" ) //Skip Image data
		echo $value["FullTagName"] . ": " . $value["Body"] . "<br />"; 
}

list($MimeType, $image) = $ID3->GetImage();

file_put_contents("thumb.jpeg", $image ); //Note the image type depends upon MimeType
```
